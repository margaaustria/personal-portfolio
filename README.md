# Personal Portfolio Website
Welcome! This portfolio is a collection of my journey as a developer, featuring my projects, skills, and background. Built using React, it serves as an interactive way for potential employers and collaborators to explore my work and connect with me.

## The Purpose
Creating this portfolio allowed me to bring together everything I've learned and built into one central hub. It's more than just a static resume—it's a dynamic showcase that reflects my personality and passion for web development.

## Sections Overview
Here's what you'll find as you explore:

### About Me
Learn a bit about who I am, my background, and what I'm passionate about.

### Projects
Check out the projects I've built:
- Ibong Adarna Quiz System
- DreamLog Website
- Etc...

Each project includes descriptions, the tech I used, and links to live demos.

### Skills
A quick snapshot of my technical and soft skills, from front-end development to UI/UX design.

### Resume
A downloadable PDF version of my resume for a quick summary of my experience and skills.
